A new year is coming and, as often happens, I do a summary of the current year and fix some objective for the new year.

This year was very beautiful year and I learned so much interesting thing that it is complex to remember all.

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/post-image/eth-logo.png" style="float:left; margin: 10px; width: 120px"/> First of all, I've learnt how to write a Smart Contract (this it [the result](https://github.com/alessandro308/COBrA)), using it with Ethereum and other free testnet. I've learnt Solidity, Truffle, Metamask and Web3JS. Probably I have to study more how to write a secure contract, but not in my next future. 

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/post-image/yelp-logo.png" style="float:right; margin: 10px; width: 200px"/> During this year I've learnt how to write a web application in an easy way, a.k.a. React. I've improved my knowledge of Bootstrap Framework and I wrote some application using the microservice design. Thanks to this knowledge, I succeed in several interviews and now I have an internship contract signed with [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com). Spoiler: I'll start it next march.

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/post-image/fb-logo.png" style="float:left; margin: 10px; width: 120px"/> After this interviews for an internship, in order to find other opportunities for my future, I've applied for a fulltime position to Facebook but, after the first technical interview, they rejected me: "Unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your candidacy for the role at this time." they said. No problem, it was a great experience. I've tested myself with another big tech companies and I improved my communication skill about algorithm design. Go on!

Thanks to ICT Risk Assessment course at University, I needed to write [software](https://apagiaro.it/network-topology-nettopo/) and, as I like, when I have no constraint I seize the opportunity to learn a new language: Go. Ok, ok, I'm not a master of Golang but I would like to improve my skill and I perform some steps on this innovative language (I hope to see it in the university in few years).

<img src="https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png" style="float:right; margin: 10px; width: 200px"/> In 2018 I started to wrote my Master Thesis and, as you can expect, I started with a new language: Python. Moreover, in order to understand better the new database approach and in order to manage my project in a more easy way, I started to study MongoDB (and I'm using it for my thesis).

# And now? Welcome 2019!
Now move on! I would like to learn new thing and start new exciting projects! I hope that Yelp gives me a lot of growth opportunity. I'll graduate on Computer Science Master Course and I'll finish my university studies (for the moment).

Just to fix some objective, from the technical point of view I would like to:
 - Learn how works and how to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)
 - Learn another web framework like [Angular](https://angular.io/) of [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
 - Improve my knowledge of CSS (and UX/UI skill in general)
 - Understand how a decentralized service can be robust to the faults  
   - Study how Netflix works (I really like the [Netflix Tech Blog](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog))
 - Improve my knowledge on design a good [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) service and how to use it in the best way 

Another great year is starting, my first year outside of my country, Italy! I'll move in German, new culture, new job, new language, new friends and, maybe, new notebook!

Let's go, and happy new year to all of you!
