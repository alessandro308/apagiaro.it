I'm a young italian developer that looking for new techologies (especially web techologies). I'm constantly looking for projects that can help me to expand my knowledge.

My tech interests are about clouding, application management and web tecnologies. I'm attending master degrees at University of Pisa (ICT Solution Architect curriculum).

From 2003 till 2018, I was a member of AGESCI, an italian scout association. My scout experience started in Rome, when I was 9, then I moved to Latina and finally in Pisa, where I was a scout leader of Pisa 3. 

Since I was in elementary school (thank you teacher Antonella!), I play chess. Sometimes you can find me on [LiChess](https://lichess.org).
On my free time I also play a guitar, even if my friends ask me to stop... But I continue, just for them pleasure!

On March 2019, I'll move to Hamburg, Germany. I'll start an intership at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.it/)! I'm hoping to graduate before that date, in this days I'm deployment my master thesis on Management Application in Fog Computing.
